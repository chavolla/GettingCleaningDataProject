##Dataset origin

The data contained was originated from an experiment, where 30 subjects using a smartphone with sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope), underwent a set of activities. The measures are collected from each sensor for every axis (X, Y and Z). Additionally operations and transformations are made over the obtained measures.

##Dataset handling and transformation

  From the previous dataset it is required to extract the information regarding mean values and standard deviation values. MeanFreq value is not included, since is a weighted average. The information about activity and subject is preserved for each observation.
  The resulting dataset is processed to obtain a tidy dataset, so that the column names are in more readable format.
